# Android-Apps
A class project that I created in Android Studios using Java and XML. The app can be ran wiht just the APK on an Android, or through an emulator in Android Studios. 
The app is a Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses the Minimax algorithm, recursively, in order to predict a player’s move and never lose a game. 
Worst case scenario, the game will end in a draw, but never allow the player to win the game.
The user can will be prompt with instructions on if they want to go first or second, where they can choose via two radio buttons. Once the game begins, the game will notify the user of the state of the game, which includes who’s turn it is and when the game is over.
