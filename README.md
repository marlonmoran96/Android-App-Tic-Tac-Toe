# Android-Apps
Class project that was created in Android Studios using Java and XML.
The app is designed for a Google Pixel 2 and will not work in landscpe mode, due to time constraints. 
The app is a Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses the Minimax algoritum, recursively, in order to predict a player’s move and never lose a game. 
Worst case scenario, the game will end in a draw, but never allow the player to win the game.
The user can will be prompt with instructions on if they want to go first or second, where they can choose via two radio buttons. 
Once the game begins, the game will notify the user of the state of the game, which includes who’s turn it is and when the game is over.
